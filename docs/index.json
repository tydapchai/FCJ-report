Specialist SA, Serverless Amazon Web Services Key Highlights Identifying the drawbacks of legacy application architecture Long product release cycles → Lost revenue/missed opportunities Inefficient operations → Reduced productivity, higher costs Non-compliance with security regulations → Security breaches, loss of reputation Transitioning to modern application architecture – Microservices Migrating to a modular system — each function is an independent service communicating via events, built on three core pillars:\nQueue Management: Handle asynchronous tasks Caching Strategy: Optimize performance Message Handling: Flexible inter-service communication Domain-Driven Design (DDD) Four-step method: Identify domain events → arrange timeline → identify actors → define bounded contexts Bookstore case study: Demonstrates real-world DDD application Context mapping: 7 patterns for integrating bounded contexts Event-Driven Architecture 3 integration patterns: Publish/Subscribe, Point-to-point, Streaming Benefits: Loose coupling, scalability, resilience Sync vs async comparison: Understanding the trade-offs Compute Evolution Shared Responsibility Model: EC2 → ECS → Fargate → Lambda Serverless benefits: No server management, auto-scaling, pay-for-value Functions vs Containers: Criteria for appropriate choice Amazon Q Developer SDLC automation: From planning to maintenance Code transformation: Java upgrade, .NET modernization AWS Transform agents: VMware, Mainframe, .NET migration Key Takeaways Design Mindset Business-first approach: Always start from the business domain, not the technology Ubiquitous language: Importance of a shared vocabulary between business and tech teams Bounded contexts: Identifying and managing complexity in large systems Technical Architecture Event storming technique: Practical method for modeling business processes Use event-driven communication instead of synchronous calls Integration patterns: When to use sync, async, pub/sub, streaming Compute spectrum: Criteria for choosing between VM, containers, and serverless Modernization Strategy Phased approach: No rushing — follow a clear roadmap 7Rs framework: Multiple modernization paths depending on the application ROI measurement: Cost reduction + business agility Applying to Work Apply DDD to current projects: Event storming sessions with business teams Refactor microservices: Use bounded contexts to define service boundaries Implement event-driven patterns: Replace some sync calls with async messaging Adopt serverless: Pilot AWS Lambda for suitable use cases Try Amazon Q Developer: Integrate into the dev workflow to boost productivity Event Experience Attending the “GenAI-powered App-DB Modernization” workshop was extremely valuable, giving me a comprehensive view of modernizing applications and databases using advanced methods and tools. Key experiences included:\nLearning from highly skilled speakers Experts from AWS and major tech organizations shared best practices in modern application design. Through real-world case studies, I gained a deeper understanding of applying DDD and Event-Driven Architecture to large projects. Hands-on technical exposure Participating in event storming sessions helped me visualize how to model business processes into domain events. Learned how to split microservices and define bounded contexts to manage large-system complexity. Understood trade-offs between synchronous and asynchronous communication and integration patterns like pub/sub, point-to-point, streaming. Leveraging modern tools Explored Amazon Q Developer, an AI tool for SDLC support from planning to maintenance. Learned to automate code transformation and pilot serverless with AWS Lambda to improve productivity. Networking and discussions The workshop offered opportunities to exchange ideas with experts, peers, and business teams, enhancing the ubiquitous language between business and tech. Real-world examples reinforced the importance of the business-first approach rather than focusing solely on technology. Lessons learned Applying DDD and event-driven patterns reduces coupling while improving scalability and resilience. Modernization requires a phased approach with ROI measurement; rushing the process can be risky. AI tools like Amazon Q Developer can significantly boost productivity when integrated into the current workflow.

They are horizontally scaled, redundant, and highly available VPC components. They allow communication between your compute resources and AWS services without imposing availability risks. Compute resources running in VPC can access Amazon S3 using a Gateway endpoint. PrivateLink interface endpoints can be used by compute resources running in VPC or on-premises. Workshop overview In this workshop, you will use two VPCs.\n\u0026ldquo;VPC Cloud\u0026rdquo; is for cloud resources such as a Gateway endpoint and an EC2 instance to test with. \u0026ldquo;VPC On-Prem\u0026rdquo; simulates an on-premises environment such as a factory or corporate datacenter. An EC2 instance running strongSwan VPN software has been deployed in \u0026ldquo;VPC On-prem\u0026rdquo; and automatically configured to establish a Site-to-Site VPN tunnel with AWS Transit Gateway. This VPN simulates connectivity from an on-premises location to the AWS cloud. To minimize costs, only one VPN instance is provisioned to support this workshop. When planning VPN connectivity for your production workloads, AWS recommends using multiple VPN devices for high availability.

AWS Management Console How it works:\nWeb-based graphical interface — sign in at https://console.aws.amazon.com and operate resources manually. Create, modify, and delete resources using point-and-click forms. Summary:\nCriterion AWS Management Console Interface Web GUI Automation level Low — manual step-by-step operations Deployment speed Slower for large numbers of resources Ease of use Easy for beginners Advantages Intuitive; good for monitoring resource state Limitations Hard to reproduce configurations, error-prone, no built-in version control Example: To launch an EC2 instance — Console → EC2 → Launch Instance → fill settings → run.\n2. Programmatic Access (CLI / SDK / API) How it works:\nAccess AWS via API, AWS CLI, or SDKs (Boto3 for Python, AWS SDK for JavaScript/Node.js, etc.). Allows automation through commands or code. Summary:\nCriterion Programmatic Access Interface CLI or code (SDK/API) Automation level Higher than Console Integration Easy to use in scripts, CI/CD pipelines Advantages Fast, scalable, supports batch operations and DevOps integration Limitations Requires technical skills and correct IAM configuration Example CLI command:\naws ec2 run-instances --image-id ami-123456 --instance-type t3.micro Or use Boto3 (Python) to create instances programmatically.\n3. Infrastructure as Code (IaC) How it works:\nDefine the entire infrastructure as code instead of manual steps. Tools: AWS CloudFormation, Terraform, AWS CDK. IaC enables consistent, repeatable deployments and is managed via version control. Summary:\nCriterion Infrastructure as Code (IaC) Interface Configuration files (YAML, JSON, HCL, TypeScript) Automation level Very high Advantages Automated, version-controlled, easy to replicate environments Limitations Requires understanding of templates and configuration management Best suited for DevOps, production, CI/CD, large-scale systems CloudFormation example:\nResources: MyEC2: Type: AWS::EC2::Instance Properties: InstanceType: t3.micro ImageId: ami-123456 Terraform example:\nresource \u0026#34;aws_instance\u0026#34; \u0026#34;example\u0026#34; { ami = \u0026#34;ami-123456\u0026#34; instance_type = \u0026#34;t3.micro\u0026#34; } 4. Quick comparison summary Criterion AWS Management Console Programmatic Access Infrastructure as Code Interaction Web GUI (manual) CLI / API Write infrastructure code Automation Low Medium Very high Repeatability No Limited Easy Version control No Partially Yes Beginner friendliness Easy Medium Harder Suitable for Learning, demos, quick tasks Scripts, small CI/CD tasks Large systems, mature DevOps Conclusion:\nManagement Console: good for learning, demos, and quick manual tasks. Programmatic Access: use for automation scripts and pipeline integration. IaC: use for professional, scalable environments with version control and reproducibility. Infrastructure fundamentals (summary) Global Footprint AWS operates 30+ regions worldwide and 550+ points of presence. Each region is a major geographic area that hosts multiple AWS services. Data Centers Located within regions; house servers, storage, and networking equipment. Designed for high availability, redundant power and cooling, and strong security. Availability Zones (AZs) Each region has multiple AZs — independent facilities with separate power, cooling, and networking. AZs enable fault tolerance and high availability; if one AZ fails, others maintain operations. Edge Locations 400+ Edge Locations globally; used by Amazon CloudFront to cache data near end users. Reduce latency and accelerate content delivery. Example: Black Friday During peak traffic (e.g., Black Friday): Data centers handle compute and storage load; AZs provide redundancy; Edge Locations deliver cached content quickly. Result: reliable, low-latency performance at global scale. Database overview Role of Databases Databases store, manage, and retrieve structured or unstructured data efficiently. Types of Databases Type Description AWS Service Best Use Cases Relational (SQL) Structured data with defined relationships Amazon RDS (MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, SQL Server) ERP, CRM, finance, e-commerce NoSQL Flexible schema, high-performance key-value store Amazon DynamoDB Gaming, IoT, session management, real-time apps Amazon RDS Fully managed relational DB service; handles provisioning, patching, backups, and scaling. Amazon DynamoDB Serverless NoSQL with single-digit millisecond latency; scales automatically with no infrastructure management. Other DB offerings Service Type Use Case Amazon ElastiCache In-memory cache Improve performance \u0026amp; reduce DB load Amazon Neptune Graph DB Social networks, recommendation engines Amazon DocumentDB Document store (MongoDB-compatible) Content management, product catalogs Amazon Timestream Time-series DB IoT telemetry, operational analytics Amazon QLDB Ledger DB Immutable, cryptographically verifiable logs AWS Database Migration Service (DMS) Enables migrations with minimal downtime; supports homogeneous and heterogeneous migrations; useful for on-premises → AWS migrations. Storage overview Role of Storage Provides durable, scalable, and secure data storage for files, backups, and archives. Types of Storage Type Description AWS Service Typical Use Direct / Active Storage Frequently accessed data; fast retrieval Amazon S3 Websites, mobile apps, analytics, backups Archival Storage Infrequently accessed data, long-term retention Amazon Glacier Archives, compliance, disaster recovery Amazon S3 Object storage designed for scalability, availability, and durability (11 9s). Use cases: website hosting, backup \u0026amp; restore, content delivery, big data. Features: versioning, encryption, lifecycle policies, cross-region replication. S3 Storage Classes Class Description Use Case S3 Standard High performance for frequent access Websites, content delivery S3 Intelligent-Tiering Automatically moves data between tiers based on usage Unpredictable access patterns S3 Standard-IA Lower cost for infrequent but rapid access Backups, DR S3 Glacier Low-cost archival, retrieval minutes–hours Long-term archives S3 Glacier Deep Archive Lowest-cost storage, retrieval hours–days Regulatory/compliance retention Amazon Glacier Archival storage for data that must be retained securely and cheaply; retrieval options: Expedited, Standard, Bulk. Other Storage Services Service Type Use Case Amazon EBS Block storage Persistent storage for EC2 instances Amazon EFS File storage Shared access across multiple instances Amazon FSx Managed file systems Enterprise or HPC workloads AWS Storage Gateway Hybrid cloud storage Connect on-premises to AWS for backups/caching Week 2 Achievements Gained practical familiarity with the AWS Management Console, AWS CLI, and basic programmatic workflows. Created and configured an AWS account and AWS CLI (access key, secret key, default region). Launched an EC2 instance, connected via SSH, and attached an EBS volume during hands-on practice. Compiled notes comparing Console, CLI, and IaC, and summarized infrastructure concepts, database offerings, and storage options. Next steps Practice IaC: author a simple CloudFormation template or Terraform configuration to recreate the EC2 + EBS setup used in practice. Explore additional DB services (RDS engines, DynamoDB patterns) and caching with ElastiCache. Automate a small deployment pipeline using AWS CLI scripts and verify repeatable deployments.

Please do not copy verbatim for your report, including this warning.\nIn this section, you need to summarize the contents of the workshop that you plan to conduct.\nIoT Weather Platform for Lab Research A Unified AWS Serverless Solution for Real-Time Weather Monitoring 1. Executive Summary The IoT Weather Platform is designed for the ITea Lab team in Ho Chi Minh City to enhance weather data collection and analysis. It supports up to 5 weather stations, with potential scalability to 10-15, utilizing Raspberry Pi edge devices with ESP32 sensors to transmit data via MQTT. The platform leverages AWS Serverless services to deliver real-time monitoring, predictive analytics, and cost efficiency, with access restricted to 5 lab members via Amazon Cognito.\n2. Problem Statement What’s the Problem? Current weather stations require manual data collection, becoming unmanageable with multiple units. There is no centralized system for real-time data or analytics, and third-party platforms are costly and overly complex.\nThe Solution The platform uses AWS IoT Core to ingest MQTT data, AWS Lambda and API Gateway for processing, Amazon S3 for storage (including a data lake), and AWS Glue Crawlers and ETL jobs to extract, transform, and load data from the S3 data lake to another S3 bucket for analysis. AWS Amplify with Next.js provides the web interface, and Amazon Cognito ensures secure access. Similar to Thingsboard and CoreIoT, users can register new devices and manage connections, though this platform operates on a smaller scale and is designed for private use. Key features include real-time dashboards, trend analysis, and low operational costs.\nBenefits and Return on Investment The solution establishes a foundational resource for lab members to develop a larger IoT platform, serving as a study resource, and provides a data foundation for AI enthusiasts for model training or analysis. It reduces manual reporting for each station via a centralized platform, simplifying management and maintenance, and improves data reliability. Monthly costs are $0.66 USD per the AWS Pricing Calculator, with a 12-month total of $7.92 USD. All IoT equipment costs are covered by the existing weather station setup, eliminating additional development expenses. The break-even period of 6-12 months is achieved through significant time savings from reduced manual work.\n3. Solution Architecture The platform employs a serverless AWS architecture to manage data from 5 Raspberry Pi-based stations, scalable to 15. Data is ingested via AWS IoT Core, stored in an S3 data lake, and processed by AWS Glue Crawlers and ETL jobs to transform and load it into another S3 bucket for analysis. Lambda and API Gateway handle additional processing, while Amplify with Next.js hosts the dashboard, secured by Cognito. The architecture is detailed below:\nAWS Services Used AWS IoT Core: Ingests MQTT data from 5 stations, scalable to 15. AWS Lambda: Processes data and triggers Glue jobs (two functions). Amazon API Gateway: Facilitates web app communication. Amazon S3: Stores raw data in a data lake and processed outputs (two buckets). AWS Glue: Crawlers catalog data, and ETL jobs transform and load it. AWS Amplify: Hosts the Next.js web interface. Amazon Cognito: Secures access for lab users. Component Design Edge Devices: Raspberry Pi collects and filters sensor data, sending it to IoT Core. Data Ingestion: AWS IoT Core receives MQTT messages from the edge devices. Data Storage: Raw data is stored in an S3 data lake; processed data is stored in another S3 bucket. Data Processing: AWS Glue Crawlers catalog the data, and ETL jobs transform it for analysis. Web Interface: AWS Amplify hosts a Next.js app for real-time dashboards and analytics. User Management: Amazon Cognito manages user access, allowing up to 5 active accounts. 4. Technical Implementation Implementation Phases This project has two parts—setting up weather edge stations and building the weather platform—each following 4 phases:\nBuild Theory and Draw Architecture: Research Raspberry Pi setup with ESP32 sensors and design the AWS serverless architecture (1 month pre-internship) Calculate Price and Check Practicality: Use AWS Pricing Calculator to estimate costs and adjust if needed (Month 1). Fix Architecture for Cost or Solution Fit: Tweak the design (e.g., optimize Lambda with Next.js) to stay cost-effective and usable (Month 2). Develop, Test, and Deploy: Code the Raspberry Pi setup, AWS services with CDK/SDK, and Next.js app, then test and release to production (Months 2-3). Technical Requirements\nWeather Edge Station: Sensors (temperature, humidity, rainfall, wind speed), a microcontroller (ESP32), and a Raspberry Pi as the edge device. Raspberry Pi runs Raspbian, handles Docker for filtering, and sends 1 MB/day per station via MQTT over Wi-Fi. Weather Platform: Practical knowledge of AWS Amplify (hosting Next.js), Lambda (minimal use due to Next.js), AWS Glue (ETL), S3 (two buckets), IoT Core (gateway and rules), and Cognito (5 users). Use AWS CDK/SDK to code interactions (e.g., IoT Core rules to S3). Next.js reduces Lambda workload for the fullstack web app. 5. Timeline \u0026amp; Milestones Project Timeline\nPre-Internship (Month 0): 1 month for planning and old station review. Internship (Months 1-3): 3 months. Month 1: Study AWS and upgrade hardware. Month 2: Design and adjust architecture. Month 3: Implement, test, and launch. Post-Launch: Up to 1 year for research. 6. Budget Estimation You can find the budget estimation on the AWS Pricing Calculator.\nOr you can download the Budget Estimation File.\nInfrastructure Costs AWS Services: AWS Lambda: $0.00/month (1,000 requests, 512 MB storage). S3 Standard: $0.15/month (6 GB, 2,100 requests, 1 GB scanned). Data Transfer: $0.02/month (1 GB inbound, 1 GB outbound). AWS Amplify: $0.35/month (256 MB, 500 ms requests). Amazon API Gateway: $0.01/month (2,000 requests). AWS Glue ETL Jobs: $0.02/month (2 DPUs). AWS Glue Crawlers: $0.07/month (1 crawler). MQTT (IoT Core): $0.08/month (5 devices, 45,000 messages). Total: $0.7/month, $8.40/12 months\nHardware: $265 one-time (Raspberry Pi 5 and sensors). 7. Risk Assessment Risk Matrix Network Outages: Medium impact, medium probability. Sensor Failures: High impact, low probability. Cost Overruns: Medium impact, low probability. Mitigation Strategies Network: Local storage on Raspberry Pi with Docker. Sensors: Regular checks and spares. Cost: AWS budget alerts and optimization. Contingency Plans Revert to manual methods if AWS fails. Use CloudFormation for cost-related rollbacks. 8. Expected Outcomes Technical Improvements: Real-time data and analytics replace manual processes.\nScalable to 10-15 stations.\nLong-term Value 1-year data foundation for AI research.\nReusable for future projects.\n"},{"uri":"https://tydapchai.github.io/FCJ-report/5-workshop/5.3-s3-vpc/5.3.2-test-gwe/","title":"Test the Gateway Endpoint","tags":[],"description":"","content":"Create S3 bucket Navigate to S3 management console In the Bucket console, choose Create bucket In the Create bucket console Name the bucket: choose a name that hasn\u0026rsquo;t been given to any bucket globally (hint: lab number and your name) Leave other fields as they are (default) Scroll down and choose Create bucket Successfully create S3 bucket.

This EC2 instance is already running in \u0026ldquo;VPC Cloud\u0026rdquo; and will be used to test connectivity to Amazon S3 through the Gateway endpoint you just created (s3-gwe).\nSession Manager will open a new browser tab with a shell prompt: sh-4.2 $\nYou have successfully start a session - connect to the EC2 instance in VPC cloud. In the next step, we will create a S3 bucket and a file in it.\nCreate a file and upload to s3 bucket Change to the ssm-user\u0026rsquo;s home directory by typing cd ~ in the CLI Create a new file to use for testing with the command fallocate -l 1G testfile.xyz, which will create a file of 1GB size named \u0026ldquo;testfile.xyz\u0026rdquo;. Upload file to S3 bucket with command aws s3 cp testfile.xyz s3://your-bucket-name. Replace your-bucket-name with the name of S3 bucket that you created earlier. You have successfully uploaded the file to your S3 bucket. You can now terminate the session.\nCheck object in S3 bucket Navigate to S3 console. Click the name of your s3 bucket In the Bucket console, you will see the file you have uploaded to your S3 bucket Section summary Congratulation on completing access to S3 from VPC. In this section, you created a Gateway endpoint for Amazon S3, and used the AWS CLI to upload an object. The upload worked because the Gateway endpoint allowed communication to S3, without needing an Internet Gateway attached to \u0026ldquo;VPC Cloud\u0026rdquo;. This demonstrates the functionality of the Gateway endpoint as a secure path to S3 without traversing the Public Internet.\n"},{"uri":"https://tydapchai.github.io/FCJ-report/1-worklog/1.10-week10/","title":"Week 10 Worklog","tags":[],"description":"","content":" ⚠️ Note: The following information is for reference purposes only.

Outside of a workshop environment, you might use this feature to forward DNS queries from your VPC to DNS servers running on-premises. In this section, you will simulate an on-premises conditional forwarder by creating a forwarding rule that forwards DNS queries for Amazon S3 to a Private Hosted Zone running in \u0026ldquo;VPC Cloud\u0026rdquo; in-order to resolve the PrivateLink interface endpoint regional DNS name.\nFrom the Route 53 management console, click Inbound endpoints on the left side bar In the Inbound endpoints console, click the ID of the inbound endpoint Copy the two IP addresses listed to your text editor From the Route 53 menu, choose Resolver \u0026gt; Rules, and click Create rule: In the Create rule console: Name: myS3Rule Rule type: Forward Domain name: s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com VPC: VPC On-prem Outbound endpoint: VPCOnpremOutboundEndpoint Target IP Addresses: Enter both IP addresses from your text editor (inbound endpoint addresses) and then click Submit You have successfully created resolver forwarding rule.\nTest the on-premises DNS Simulation Connect to Test-Interface-Endpoint EC2 instance with Session manager Test DNS resolution.
