# MapVibe - Building an AI-Powered Location Discovery Platform

#### Overview

**MapVibe** is a modern web application that helps users discover dining and activity locations using natural language queries powered by AWS AI services. Built with a monorepo architecture using TurboRepo and Bun, MapVibe leverages AWS serverless services to provide a scalable, cost-effective solution.

In this workshop, you will learn how to:
- Set up and configure a monorepo project structure
- Deploy infrastructure using Terraform on AWS
- Build and deploy serverless Lambda functions
- Configure AWS services including RDS, Cognito, CloudFront, API Gateway, and Bedrock
- Develop a full-stack application with React frontend and Node.js backend

The project demonstrates modern cloud architecture patterns using:
- **Monorepo Architecture** - TurboRepo for efficient builds and dependency management
- **Serverless Backend** - AWS Lambda functions for API endpoints and processing
- **AI Integration** - AWS Bedrock for natural language processing and embeddings
- **Infrastructure as Code** - Terraform for managing AWS resources
- **Modern Frontend** - React 19 with Vite and TailwindCSS
